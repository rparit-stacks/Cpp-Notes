### Procedural vs. Object-Oriented Development

1. **Procedural Programming:**
   - **Definition:** A programming paradigm based on the concept of the procedure call. Procedures, also known as routines, subroutines, or functions, simply contain a series of computational steps to be carried out.
   - **Characteristics:**
     - Code is written as a sequence of instructions.
     - Focuses on a top-down approach.
     - Relies heavily on procedure calls and global variables.
     - Often leads to code duplication.
   - **Limitations:**
     - Not suitable for complex applications.
     - Difficulties in maintaining and modifying code.

2. **Object-Oriented Programming:**
   - **Definition:** A programming paradigm based on the concept of objects, which can contain data and methods.
   - **Characteristics:**
     - Encapsulates data and operations.
     - Implements the concept of classes and objects.
     - Facilitates code reusability through inheritance and polymorphism.
     - Supports abstraction and encapsulation.
   - **Advantages:**
     - Easier maintenance and modification of code.
     - Better suited for large, complex, and actively updated software.
     - Promotes code reusability.

### Basic Concepts of OOP

1. **Classes and Objects:**
   - **Classes:** Define the structure and behaviour of objects. Think of it as a blueprint for creating objects.
   - **Objects:** Instances of classes. They encapsulate data and functions that manipulate data.

2. **Inheritance:**
   - Enables new classes to receive, or inherit, the properties and methods of existing classes. Useful for code reusability and establishing a hierarchy.

3. **Polymorphism:**
   - Allows objects to be treated as instances of their parent class. It can be static (compile-time) or dynamic (run-time). Facilitates flexibility in interfaces.

4. **Encapsulation:**
   - The bundling of data with the methods that operate on that data. It restricts direct access to some of an object's components, which is useful for security and integrity.

5. **Abstraction:**
   - Hiding complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features. This concept simplifies programming.

### Applications and Benefits of OOP

1. **Applications:**
   - Used extensively in software development, especially in systems that are large, complex, and continuously evolving.
   - Widely applied in developing GUI applications, web applications, and real-time systems.

2. **Benefits:**
   - **Modularity:** The source code for an object can be written and maintained independently.
   - **Reusability:** Objects can be reused across programs.
   - **Productivity:** The principles of OOP facilitate quicker and less expensive software development.
   - **Scalability:** Suitable for building large-scale systems.

This table summarizes the key differences between C and C++ based on the provided information. It highlights their programming paradigms, simplicity, control over system resources, support for objects and classes, and common use cases..


### Stream-Based I/O

1. **Definition:** In C++, input/output operations are performed using streams. A stream is an abstraction that represents a device on which input and output operations are performed.
2. **Key Concepts:**
   - `cin`: Standard input stream, typically represents keyboard input.
   - `cout`: Standard output stream, typically used for output to the console.
   - `cerr`: Standard error stream, used for error messages, typically output to the console.
   - `clog`: Used for general-purpose logging.

### Literals and Constant Qualifiers

1. **Literals:** Fixed values in the code, like `int a = 5;` where `5` is an integer literal.
2. **Constant Qualifiers:**
   - `const`: Specifies that a variable's value cannot be modified.
   - Usage: `const int x = 10;` means `x` cannot be changed during the program.

### Operators in C++

1. **Arithmetic Operators:** Like `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%` for basic mathematical operations.
2. **Relational Operators:** Such as `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=` for comparing values.
3. **Logical Operators:** Include `&&` (AND), `||` (OR), `!` (NOT).
4. **Assignment Operators:** Like `=`, `+=`, `-=`, etc., used to assign values to variables.

### Reference Variables

1. **Definition:** A reference variable is an alias for another variable.
2. **Usage:** `int& ref = original;` - Here, `ref` is a reference to `original`.

### Functions

1. **Definition:** Functions are blocks of code that perform a specific task.
2. **Structure:** Consists of a return type, function name, parameters (if any), and a body.

### Default Arguments

1. **Definition:** Default arguments are values provided in a function declaration that are used if no argument is passed for that parameter.
2. **Example:** `void func(int x=10) { /*...*/ }` - Here, `x` will be `10` if no value is provided.

### Parameter Passing

1. **By Value:** Copies the actual value of an argument into the formal parameter of the function.
2. **By Reference:** Passes a reference to the argument, not a copy. Changes in the function affect the original argument.
3. **By Pointer:** Similar to reference, but uses pointers. Changes made inside the function are reflected outside it.

### Inline Functions

1. **Definition:** Functions defined with the `inline` keyword, hinting the compiler to insert the complete body of the function wherever it is called, to save overhead of a function call.
2. **Usage:** Best used for small, frequently called functions.

### Type Conversion

1. **Implicit Conversion:** Automatically performed by the compiler.
2. **Explicit Conversion (Casting):** Manually converting one data type into another. Example: `int x = (int)y;`

### Basic C++ Programs

1. **Hello World Example:**
   ```cpp
   #include <iostream>
   using namespace std;

   int main() {
       cout << "Hello, World!";
       return 0;
   }
   ```

### New and Delete Operators

1. **`new` Operator:** Allocates memory dynamically on the heap.
   - Usage: `int* ptr = new int;`
2. **`delete` Operator:** Deallocates memory from the heap.
   - Usage: `delete ptr;`
3. **Dynamic Memory Allocation for Arrays:**
   - Allocation: `int* arr = new int[10];`
   - Deallocation: `delete[] arr;`

Understanding these concepts is crucial for developing proficiency in C++. They form the foundation of more advanced topics and practical programming in C++.
